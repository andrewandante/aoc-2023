# Advent of Code 2023

https://adventofcode.com/2023

Showing my working for Advent of Code 2023. This is also me learning how to Python

## How to run?

Each day is copied from the `day0` dir as a starting point.

Each input is saved into `input.txt` for each day.

Running `python3 dayN/exec.py` will read the file and split by line. Then the rest is up to me!
